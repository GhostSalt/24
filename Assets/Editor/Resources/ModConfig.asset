  description: 'Yet another module named after a number. I don''t know if that''s
    a good thing or a bad thing.


    This module was inspired by a fact that my Maths / Further Maths teacher told
    me:

    "You can make 24 with any set of distinct single-digit natural numbers, using
    addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and using all four numbers.",
    or something like that.

    That statement is actually not true. A counter example is {3, 4, 6, 7}, which,
    among others, is on this module''s blacklist.

    There''s an interesting set, namely {1, 3, 4, 6}, which only has one solution:
    6/(1-(3/4)), which I thought was cool. It doesn''t work with the module, though.


    Twitch Plays supported, as always. :)'
